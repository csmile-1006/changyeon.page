Hello. I am a PhD student at <a href="https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST</a>, advised by <a href="https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html">Jinwoo Shin</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kiminlee">Kimin Lee</a>, and a visiting PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> advised by <a href="https://yukezhu.me/">Yuke Zhu</a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/">Honglak Lee</a> at University of Michigan and <a href="https://clvrai.com/web_lim/">Joseph J. Lim<a/> at KAIST.

My research interest lies on applying RL algorithms to challenging tasks where reward specification is burdensome. To this end, I am focusing on designing RL algorithms to tackle practical and challenging scenarios like environments without well-shaped rewards and unseen novel environments. 
I am also broadly interested in RL researches including RL with representation learning, language‚Äêconditioned RL, and offline RL.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a machine learning engineer at Recommendation Team of <a href="https://kakaocorp.com">Kakao</a>. Before that, I completed my BS in Computer Science at KAIST.
