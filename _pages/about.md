Hello. I am a PhD student at <a href="https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST</a>, advised by <a href="https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html">Jinwoo Shin</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kiminlee">Kimin Lee</a>, and a visiting PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> advised by <a href="https://yukezhu.me/">Yuke Zhu</a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/">Honglak Lee</a> at UMich and <a href="https://clvrai.com/web_lim/">Joseph J. Lim<a/> at KAIST.

My research centers on <b>training artificial agents to align with human intents, even when explicit reward signals are limited or unavailable.</b> I focus on developing algorithms that derive suitable reward functions from real human preferences or foundational vision-language models, which encapsulate extensive human knowledge. Beyond this primary theme, I also explore broader decision-making challenges, including (M)LLM-based agents, offline reinforcement learning, and generalization of RL solutions across diverse environments.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a machine learning engineer at Recommendation Team of <a href="https://kakaocorp.com">Kakao</a>. Before that, I completed my BS in Computer Science at KAIST.
